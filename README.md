# GaruBdayBot
This bot aims to run daily to check if it is someone's birthday, if it is, will celebrate their birthday in the Garuda chat

HOW TO USE: it is self sufficient and will be running on pythonanywhere (free python script hosting service, will drop details for the account in tech chat) (code is to be updated on pythonanywhere, the version on github is just a copy to save the code)

HOW TO CONFIGURE: the bot looks at a google sheet within the repo and will automatically update. Need to also change the CHAT_ID to our garuda chat ID next AY
